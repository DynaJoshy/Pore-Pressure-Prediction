# Pore Pressure Prediction

A pore pressure prediction project generally aims to estimate the fluid pressure (often water or oil) within the pores of underground rock formations. This is especially important in fields such as petroleum, geotechnical engineering, and civil engineering, where knowledge of pore pressure is essential for drilling operations, reservoir management, and ensuring safety during excavation activities.
